## Unreleased

- Conservative pre-release version handling along with a flag to turn it off. See [this issue][194] for details.
- Rename `--allow-auto-publish-of-stable-crates` to `--no-auto-publish-of-stable-crates`, inverting its meaning.
- Add `--no-multi-crate-release` flag to return to previous default behaviour. All crate manifest changes are put into one commit.
- automatically bump pre-release transient dependents of published crates to prevent breakage down the road unless 
  `--no-isolate-dependencies-from-breaking-change` is set.
